            <article class="card">
        <h3>Chosen Idea: AI for Productivity</h3><br>
        <p><strong>Summary<br></strong>Optimizing personal and team productivity is a universal challenge, especially in knowledge work where productivity is hard to measure. An integrated AI tool, such as <em>ClickUp Brain</em> within a project management platform, can boost productivity by generating updates/standups, retrieving project information, automating schedules, and balancing workloads across cross-functional teams.</p><br>

        <h4>Application to my world</h4>
        <p>As a student and aspiring game developer, productivity tools are essential for managing assignments, projects, and team collaborations. An AI-powered project management tool could help track deadlines for coursework, automatically generate project progress reports, and schedule tasks for group projects that I'm collaborating on. In a future studio setting, this tool would optimize workflows by assigning programming, art, and sound design tasks efficiently, ensuring the team stays aligned without wasting hours in meetings.</p><br><br>

        <h3>Ethical Concerns & Solutions</h3><br>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Over-automation</strong><br>Relying too much on AI could reduce critical thinking and decision-making by humans.<br> <em>Solution:</em> Use AI as an assistant, not a replacement; humans still approve final decisions.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Privacy & surveillance</strong><br>AI tracking productivity could feel invasive.<br> <em>Solution:</em> Transparency — allow workers/students to see what data is collected and give them control over its use.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Bias in workload assignment</strong><br>If the AI misjudges effort, some people may get overloaded.<br> <em>Solution:</em> Train AI with balanced data and allow manual adjustments to workload distribution.</li><br>
        </ul>

        <h4>Real example app</h4>
        <p>An example: <a href="https://www.notion.com/product/ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notion AI</a><br>Notion is a workspace tool that combines notes, docs, tasks, databases, and project tracking. Its AI assists in writing, summarizing content, generating task lists from meeting notes, autofilling tables, and organizing information. It's useful for people who want everything in one place and less switching between tools.</p><br>
