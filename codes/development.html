                <h3>Chapter 4 Summary</h3>
                <p>In Chapter 4, Michael continues learning from Charlie about the importance of surrounding yourself with the right people. Charlie explains to him that success and personal growth are often influenced by the people you spend the most time with. He encourages Michael to check his friendships and make sure he is associating himself with individuals who inspire and motivate him toward his goals.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Reflection<br></strong>This chapter emphasizes how our environment and relationships can impact our success. It made me think about the people I spend time with and whether they help me grow or hold me back and I have even made decisions to remove some persons from my life. The message encourages building positive relationships and avoiding negative influences, which is something I want to apply in my own life.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 5 Summary</h3>
                <p>Chapter 5 focuses on setting goals and writing them down. Charlie tells Michael that success starts with having a clear vision for what you want to achieve. He explains that goals should be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound (SMART). Writing them down and reviewing them regularly helps you to keep yourself focused and accountable.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Reflection<br></strong>This chapter reminded me of the power of setting goals; speaking goals into existence and manifesting them. Writing goals down makes them feel more real and motivates me to take action. I learned that without clear goals, it's easy to drift without direction. I plan to write out my short and long-term goals so I can stay focused on the different things I want to achieve.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 6 Summary</h3>
                <p>In Chapter 6, Charlie teaches Michael about time management. He explains that successful people value and manage their time very carefully, prioritizing activities that contribute to their goals. Charlie also mentions the “80/20 rule,” which means that 80% of your results can come from 20% of your efforts.</p>
                <p><strong>Reflection<br></strong>This chapter helped me understand how important it is to use my time wisely. Time management was a bit of an issue for me in completing this IA. I realized that I often waste time on things that don't really matter or things that can be done after my work is completed. Moving forward, I want to focus more on tasks that actually bring me closer to my goals and reduce distractions.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 7 Summary</h3>
                <p>Chapter 7 explores the idea of continuous learning and personal development, something this resonated with me heavily. Charlie advises Michael to invest in his own growth by reading books, attending seminars, and learning from others. He explains that lifelong learning keeps the mind sharp and helps people adapt to change.</p>
                <p><strong>Reflection<br></strong>This chapter inspired me to keep on learning new things every day. It showed me that education doesn't stop even after school. It is something we should pursue throughout our lives. I want to start reading even more and finding ways to improve myself, both personally and professionally.</p>
